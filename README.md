# CreditCardFraudDetection
A project to determine the best machine model that predicts a fraudulent credit card transaction.

Models used in my analysis: 
1) Decision Tree
2) K-Nearest Neighbors
3) Logistic Regression
4) Support Vector Machine
5) Random Forest Classifier
6) XG Boost Classification

Ultimately, I found out that Logistic Regression gave the best results while detecting a credit card fraud.
